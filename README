Scripts and other tools to import the data from the Global Terrorism Database into a Postgresql database for further work.

Steps to create and populate the database:

1. python create_tables.py
     Creates all the subtables for foreign keys as well as the master 'gtd' table.
2. python insert_data.py
     Reads each line of gtd.csv and imports it into the chosen database.

Detailed information about the database can be found online:

It can be downloaded in .xlsx format:

The gtd.csv file in this repository is a simple CSV export from Excel with the following tweaks:
    The countries file contains 192 = St. Martin, which is not listed in the codebook.
