Scripts and other tools to import the data from the Global Terrorism Database into a Postgresql database for further work.

To have a working database quickly populated with the data, download the setup package, which already contains a backup based off of commit 0a7f469621:
  wget https://github.com/downloads/brewerja/GTD_Import/setup_package.tgz
And execute setup.sh to do the heavy lifting.

Steps to create and populate the database without using the scripts in this project and not the backup above:
  1. createdb -T template_postgis dbname
     (Optional) Create a postgis enabled database.
  2. Edit settings.py to reflect the desired username and database.
  3. python create_tables.py
     Creates all the subtables for foreign keys as well as the master 'gtd' table.
  4. python insert_data.py
     Reads each line of gtd.csv and imports it into the chosen database.

Detailed information about the database can be found online:
  http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf

It can be downloaded in .xlsx format:
  http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/

The gtd.csv file in this repository is a simple CSV export from Excel with the following tweaks:
  The countries file contains 192 = St. Martin, which is not listed in the codebook.
  Incident #200002250007 has a 'claimed' attribute of '2', which is non-valid and ignored.

To be able to repopulate the database quickly, it's helpful to create a backup:
  pg_dump dbname -f gtd_database.sql
